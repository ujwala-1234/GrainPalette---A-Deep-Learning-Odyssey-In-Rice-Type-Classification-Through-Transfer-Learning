# GrainPalette ‚Äì A Deep Learning Odyssey in Rice Type Classification

GrainPalette is a deep learning-powered web application that classifies rice grain types using transfer learning. It allows users to upload an image and receive real-time predictions through a clean and modern web interface built with Flask.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Development Process

The development of **GrainPalette** followed a structured approach integrating deep learning, data preprocessing, and web application development. Below is a detailed breakdown of the process:

---

### üìÅ 1. Dataset Collection & Preparation

- The dataset was organized into **five folders**, each representing a rice type: `Basmati`, `Jasmine`, `Arborio`, `Brown`, and `White`.
- Each folder contained multiple rice grain images captured in similar conditions.
- The image directory structure helped in **automatic labeling** using `ImageDataGenerator` or `os.walk()`.

> **Structure:**
> ```
> dataset/
> ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Basmati/
> ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Jasmine/
> ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Arborio/
> ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Ipsala/
> ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Karacadag/
> ```

---

###  2. Data Preprocessing

- All images were resized to a consistent size `(224x224)` for compatibility with CNN models.
- Pixel values were normalized by dividing by 255.0.
- Data was split into **training** and **validation** sets with an 80-20 ratio.
- Techniques such as **augmentation** (rotation, zoom, flips) were optionally used to improve generalization.

---

###  3. Model Building Using Transfer Learning

- A **pre-trained CNN architecture**  was used as a base model.
- The top layers were **customized** to match the 5-class classification task.
- The model was compiled using:
  - `Adam` optimizer
  - `categorical_crossentropy` loss
  - `accuracy` as the evaluation metric

- Training was done using Keras with `model.fit()` and included callbacks like `EarlyStopping` to avoid overfitting.

---

### üìà 4. Model Evaluation

- Accuracy and loss graphs were plotted for training and validation sets.
- A **classification report** was generated to evaluate precision, recall, F1-score.
- Confusion matrix and sample predictions were visualized to understand model behavior.

---

###  5. Model Saving

- Once trained, the model was saved as a `rice.h5` file using:

```python
model.save("rice_model.h5")
